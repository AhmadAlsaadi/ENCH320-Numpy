This repo contains hands-on introduction to numpy in form two jupyter notebooks. The repo consist mainly of two files.   
**Numpy Part 1**:
* What is NumPy
* Who created NumPy
* Why do we learn NumPy
* How do NumPy arrays look like?
* Installing Numpy
* Importing NumPy library
* Creating NumPy Arrays from Python Lists and Tuples
  * Creating 1D-array
  * Creating 2D-array
* Creating NumPy array with specific values
* Creating NumPy arrays from evenly spaced sequence of numbers
* Creating Numpy arrays from random numbers
* NumPy Array Attributes
* Array Indexing and Slicing
   * Array Indexing
   * Array Slicing
**Numpy Part 2**:
* Array Manipulation
  * Reshaping Arrays
  * Resizing Arrays
  * Flattening Arrays
  * Reversing Array
  * Array Concatenation
  * Array Stacking
  * Array Splitting
  * Array Transposing
* Mathematical Operations on Arrays
  * Basic Mathematic Operations
  * Arrays Broadcasting
  * Numpy Universal Functions
  * Working with mathematical formulas
* File Input and Output in NumPy
  * Saving NumPy Arrays to Files:
  * Loading Data from Files
* Conclusion
Each file contains about 33 task to done by the learners. The files also contains some challenges that is some how a little bet harder than the tasks.
prequistes:
The introduction assumes that the learner have some background about python fundamentals. For those who do not know anything about python, they can visit (python-principles website)[https://pythonprinciples.com/]
to learn some python principles in order to be ready for the introduction about NumPy.
