## Introduction
Numerical methods are essential for solving mathematical problems that cannot be addressed analytically. This repository focuses on hands-on learning, providing practical examples and exercises to help you grasp the concepts of numerical differentiation, integration, root finding, and more. Each notebook contains various tasks and challenges to reinforce learning.

## Prerequiste
To get the most out of this repository, you should have a basic understanding of Python. If you're new to Python, we recommend checking out resources like ![Python Principles](https://pythonprinciples.com/) before diving into these notebooks.

## Repository Structure
This repository consists of several Jupyter notebook files organized into categories:
