**Root Finding**

**Numerical Integration and Differentiation**
Each file contains about 33 tasks to be done by the learners. The files also contains some challenges that is some how a bet harder than the tasks.   

**Pre-requistes**:   

The introduction assumes that the learner have some background about python fundamentals. For those who do not know anything about python, they can visit [python-principles website](https://pythonprinciples.com/)
to learn some python principles in order to be ready for this introduction about NumPy.
